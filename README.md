This project will try to follow [Semantic Commit Messages](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716) methodology in the development process.

# Development

You're gonna need to have values for all properties in order to properly start or deploy the application. Contact [@MilosPaunovic](https://github.com/MilosPaunovic) if you need any help with it.

### Start in development mode
